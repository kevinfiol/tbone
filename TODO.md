# todo

- [x] player animations
- [x] scrolling bg
- [x] ground tile collisions
- [x] jumping
- [x] projectile attack
- [x] fix animations (when the player shoots while walking, holds jump button on landing)
- [x] projectile sprite
- [x] make projectile sprite less ugly
- [x] camera (zoomed in -- just means smaller screensize and follow player)
    - [x] fix projectiles cuz now they dont draw with the game screen sizes (need to find a way to consistently check if something if offscreen even while camera is moving)
- [x] made new two maps as a Tiled world
- [ ] single screen transition
- [ ] turn weapon into spear
    - [ ] can only shoot one spear at a time (or per screen)
    - [ ] spear should stick to walls
    - [ ] spear should be a platform when stuck on a wall
- [ ] wall jump
- [ ] enemy idle animation
- [ ] projectile kills enemy
- [ ] projectile has "poof" animation when collides
- [ ] basic enemy ai (maybe just walks back and forth? unaggressive?)
- [ ] figure out a more sophisticated tagging system for colliders and fixture masks/filters
- [ ] shoot midair animation
- [ ] use sprite batch for projectiles

# ideas

* single spear platform
* maybe you can't kill enemies, only push them or use them as platforms
* maybe a rising endless climber? use the spear to keep going higher
